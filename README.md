# GoggleBot
This is a web scraping bot made in Python for Discord. After adding the bot to a server, the bot looks for the command "g-" and then searches the request.
If a video is being requested, the bot will repsond with a link to Youtube. Otherwise, the bot will respond with an article or tweet depending on the search.
